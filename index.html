                <br>
            <p id="bio1">My three senior years of high school, grade ten to matric, were when I first discovered my passion for computer science. Since then, I have been able to further explore the field in my university course which specialises in the development of software but covers all aspects of computer science at a basic level. </p>
                <br>
            <p id="bio2">
                During my first year there I was able to spend time learning more about not only the field itself, but how each aspect of it plays its own unique role in the software development process and by extension, the world of business. My second year of the course has allowed me to further expand upon my understanding of several foundational computer science and software development concepts which I look forward to developing further this year and beyond.</p>
                <br>
            <p id="bio3">
                I look forward to applying and improving my skills in the coming year in a workplace environment as well as in my university and personal life.</p>
